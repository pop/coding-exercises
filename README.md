# Coding Exercises

Coding exercises to get gooder at algorithms and computers

## Structure

At the top level we have different languages.

Within each language we have a library consisting of different puzzle/algorithm implementations.

I have tried to make each language idiomatic in it's structure and interface.

Sometimes there is an interactive component, but usually you'll need to read the tests/benchmarks/examples.

## Other stuff

I'm also trying to follow [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits].
