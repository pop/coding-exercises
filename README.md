# Coding Exercises

Coding exercises to get gooder at algorithms and computers

## Structure

At the top level we have different languages.

Within each language we have a folder for each exercise.
Usually an implementation of an algorithm or solution to a puzzle.

## Other stuff

I'm also trying to follow [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits].
